cucumber-performance
====================

A work in progress!

This project builds a Jenkins plugin to deliver reporting on the performance of Cucumber test projects.

Currently it delivers a single report at project level, which simply graphs the time taken for the complete test run, in seconds.

Future plans are to develop the reporting to be considerably more sophisticated.

It is still alpha, probably buggy and definitely not fit for prime time!

It is based on the excellent Cucumber reporting plugins developed by Kingsley Hendrickse and Masterthought, and available at https://github.com/masterthought

Many thanks to them for their hard work!
