cucumber-performance
====================

A plugin for the Jenkins continuous integration tool which allows for reporting over time of the performance of tests executed using the Cucumber-JVM framework.

This project is now unmaintained
--------------------------------
Due to pressures of time, along with lack of access to a large-scale Cucumber project to facilitate testing, I'm no longer in a position to maintain this project. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback and assistance.

The code is now hosted in the jenkinsci organisation, at https://github.com/jenkinsci/cucumber-performance-plugin

Should anyone wish to take over as maintainer, please contact me on jegallagher@gmail.com - all welcome!
