I'm not putting a formal license in place for this code, but would ask that people observe the following rules:

1. This code is for the use of all, for any purpose, without charge.
2. If you make changes that improve the code, please feed them back into the codebase. Contact the maintainer(s) for details on how to do this if you're unsure.

Enjoy.
